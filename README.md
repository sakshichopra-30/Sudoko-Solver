# Sudoko-Solver

## Sudoko Solver
In this part of the project, we can solve any Sudoko Puzzle. To solve a puzzle a user needs to provide some input. Input could be through command prompt or through a text file in which all the numbers which are previously present in the puzzle are written as it is and empty cells are denoted through '0'.
Now our algorithm which is a backtracking algorithm will create some possibilities and the possibility which will give appropriate results will be considered as solution of that puzzle.

## Sudoko Vaildator
In this part of the project, we can check if the a puzzle is correctly solved sudoko puzzle or not. To check if a puzzle is a solved puzzle or not user has to provide some input. Input again could be in 2 different forms, one through command prompt or the other through file. 
To check if a puzzle is correct sudoko puzzle or not we will check that no number from 1-9 should be repeated in same row, same column and a grid of 3x3. If all our condition is true for all 81 cells, then the given puzzle is correct sudoko puzzle.
